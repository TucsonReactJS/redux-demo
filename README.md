# Redux Demo

This is the Redux demo showed at the [React Router and Animation Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tucson-ReactJS-Meetup/events/223769210/) on 7/27/15 and uses these libraries:

* [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design)
* [Material UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)

To run it, clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open localhost:3000 to view the demo.

For context, it's helpful if you watch the fantastic [ReactJS Europe talk on Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux.
